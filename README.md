# NightWave

**Current review work:** [NETWORK01 media transport and I/O](docs/NETWORK_TRANSPORT_THROUGHPUT.md), [fix/nightwave-network-throughput](https://github.com/Nahian2002/NightWave/tree/fix/nightwave-network-throughput), [draft PR #153](https://github.com/Nahian2002/NightWave/pull/153) stacked on NW135 #152. Playback negotiates HTTP/2 where supported, clients reuse pools, bounded read-ahead has more room and small reads are batched before disk sync. Audio quality/source selection and all themes/features remain. Recorded 14-19 KB/s and buffering prompted this work; actual phone improvement and the limiting hop remain unverified.

**Current integrated source:** [`main`](https://github.com/Nahian2002/NightWave/tree/main), based on NW126 and the cumulative implementation. **Canonical `main` contains the reviewed cumulative source.**

**29 October 2026 verification:** **1,697 JVM tests / 212 suites**, **71 source checks** and full Android/Compose/instrumentation-source build pass. Lint: 0 errors / 314 warnings / 17 hints; one added notice keeps the adapter aligned with pinned Media3. Nine network/I/O JVM cases execute; one new Android local-source case and earlier 612 theme cases compile only. Build **3733A8B0** retains signing identity. Phone throughput/audio/data/resource checks remain pending. See [current verification](TEST_REPORT.md).

**Active next-upgrade plan:** [NW126–NW145 product-quality roadmap](docs/PRODUCT_QUALITY_ROADMAP.md), based on the [28 October recording/source audit](docs/audits/2026-10-28_PRODUCT_QUALITY_AUDIT.md). Provisional product rating **6.7/10**; 9.5+ is the target, not an achieved certification. **Next source batch: NW136.** NW126–NW135 are locally verified with physical acceptance pending. The audit/plan and gate repair are on [`audit/nightwave-post-nw125-quality-roadmap`](https://github.com/Nahian2002/NightWave/tree/audit/nightwave-post-nw125-quality-roadmap).

**Public release: NO-GO.** Installed-phone signer continuity, Samsung acceptance, production OAuth/Drive restore and source-rights review remain separate gates. A successful build does not authorize distribution or certify phone behavior.

The cumulative source contains NW122's measured host performance work, NW123's accessibility/large-text improvements, and NW124's user-confirmed playlist text import/export, conservative Commons discovery and sleep-timer improvements. The new audit identifies 32 findings and preserves the original 139-case matrix. The owner's recording supplies useful visual evidence; controlled phone performance, data-preserving upgrade, live restore and playback soak still require the explicit acceptance runs.

## Features

| Area | Development source |
| --- | --- |
| Library | Owned/authorized local audio, liked songs, recent history, playlists, folders, sorting and bounded multiselect |
| Player | Media3 background playback, queue, shuffle/repeat, seeking, mini-player and expanded Now Playing |
| Lyrics | Explicit local LRC import/review/edit/export, full-screen follow, fine timing and accessible controls |
| Audio | Sound Studio, session-aware EQ and offline transition controls |
| Optional Drive | Consented backup, preview/restore and personal audio locker workflows |
| Discovery | Saved-music search and experimental public-video discovery |

Public video references and playable offline files are separate. Saving a URL does not download audio or grant storage rights. Unsupported or restricted streams can fail. There is no required NightWave server, paid account or subscription.

## Build on Windows

Use a fresh clone or full ZIP of the **current integrated source branch linked above**, then run `build-windows.cmd`. Require a fresh success in `dist/NightWave-build-status.txt`. Before installing, run `check-device-update.cmd` and verify the signer matches the existing app. Preserve playlists, music and settings; never uninstall or clear storage to force an upgrade.

Developers can run `python tools/verify_current.py` for structural and Windows preflight checks. Workflow definitions remain in `.github/workflows/`, but repository Actions is deliberately disabled after source publication. Run local verification; no hosted CI pass is claimed. Real JVM and Android compilation remain mandatory.

| Build identity | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Application ID | `com.nightwave.player` |
| Version | `2.0.0-alpha5s`, code `35` |
| Android | API 26 minimum, compile/target API 36 |
| Toolchain | AGP 8.10.1, Gradle 8.11.1, Kotlin 2.0.21, Java 17 target |
