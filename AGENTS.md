# NightWave continuity instructions

Before choosing or implementing an upgrade, read:

1. `docs/PRODUCT_QUALITY_ROADMAP.md` — active product plan and next batch.
2. `docs/quality/NW126_NW145_BACKLOG.json` — batch status, dependencies and acceptance criteria.
3. `docs/audits/2026-10-28_PRODUCT_QUALITY_AUDIT.md` and `TEST_REPORT.md` — baseline findings and verification limits.

The current review branch adds NW133 player/artwork/status/seek work to protected public-source parent `48abd3055aaf0d2ec7a736c7e85e79bf95dcee3b`. Read docs/NW133_PLAYER_ARTWORK_METADATA.md and the latest backlog plus NW126–NW133 evidence; physical acceptance is pending. `main` is the canonical reviewed cumulative source; NW133 remains on its review branch until merged. Do not merge an old v0.8 tag or historical branch over it.

When the owner says "next", select the first eligible incomplete batch in the active backlog. The next source batch is **NW134**; NW126–NW133 are locally verified with physical checks pending. Check the actual checkout, remote updates and the latest ledger first. Do not restart NW111–NW125 simply because historical documents contain old next-step text.

Preserve package/signing identity, installed data, guest profiles, Google consent/account boundaries, playlists, history, local music, original URLs and migration evidence. Inspect caller wiring as well as pure policies; a large synthetic benchmark does not prove the UI supplies the whole library. Do not remove safeguards or tests to improve a score.

For every batch, update its status, findings addressed, exact commit/build evidence, remaining device checks and the next batch in the backlog and roadmap. Keep implementation, JVM/Android compilation, device verification and release approval separate. Independent work may proceed with documented device checks pending; final 9.5 certification requires the actual acceptance evidence.

Ratings are a subjective product-review rubric. Code changes, passing string checks and test counts cannot automatically increase the rating. Re-rate against the same rubric using current screenshots, task outcomes and device results. Preserve the original NightWave identity and declared local-first scope; do not claim Spotify's catalog, device network or service scale.

Use isolated checkpoints and a reviewable branch. Keep private recordings, extracted frames, accounts, credentials, APKs and generated logs outside Git. Retain historical roadmaps and the original 139-case matrix as evidence; the active plan extends them.

## Maintenance continuity

Current source includes maintenance on `main`, based on NW132 `aa6a56fd553a297d5aa790f6049a1f4634a11b63`. Read TEST_REPORT.md and docs/REPOSITORY_MAINTENANCE_20261028.md before more cleanup. Retain historical evidence and useful incremental caches; project housekeeping does not authorize deleting personal folders. NW133 is locally verified on its review branch; NW134 is next.

## Completed source-only publication

Source is public on canonical `main` after explicit owner authorization. Read SOURCE_PUBLICATION.md and .github/security/source-publication-result.json. Publication preserved NW132 maintenance app bytes; later NW133 product changes are separately authorized on their review branch. Actions is deliberately disabled; public secret scanning/push protection, private reporting and main review protections were read back. Owner admin bypass is retained; hosted required checks are not configured. Do not re-enable Actions, publish APKs, or change dependency/provider behavior incidentally. NW133 is locally verified on its review branch; NW134 is next.

## Historical repository publication preparation

The owner explicitly requires no app changes for public-repository preparation. On `audit/nightwave-public-source-preparation`, preserve all `app/`, `tools/`, Gradle/build inputs, package/signing identity and installed data at NW130 parent `fb8f0455c6903249ab85299a76566153a2b8d2a7`. Read [SOURCE_PUBLICATION.md](SOURCE_PUBLICATION.md). Work is limited to repository workflows, documentation and publication controls. Dependency advisories and provider/rights issues must be recorded without silently changing features or libraries. Do not switch visibility, delete/rewrite history or publish binaries as an incidental cleanup step. The preparation ended unchanged at `e476a979491dcb09fa4734e2763c0f357b6c2cd9`. Separately authorized NW131–NW132 product changes follow on their own branches; the active next batch is NW134 after locally verified NW133.
